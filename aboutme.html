        <p>Hello and welcome to this section.</p>

        <p>My name is Stein Arild</p>
        <p>I'm 32 years old and father of 2 young girls named Annabelle and Aria.
        I met my fiancee at the age of 15 and were still together to this day, I dont know what I would do without her!👨‍👩‍👧‍👧<br>
           I have always been a hands on kinda guy, so at an early age I found computers very interesting, 
           this started out as a simple replacement for a console for gaming but evolved quickly because I'm a very
           curious person by nature into teaching myself more about how a computer functions. 
           I wanted to learn what components in the computer is in charge of what and I ended up eventually 
           with building my very first computer myself. 
           This gave me a pretty good understanding of how the computer functions, but I wasnt done, this was simply the beginning.
           I wanted to know about 'overclocking' and what that does to a computer. I know this is like boosting the performance in your car, 
           this logically might cause components to produce more heat since they are working harder to perform their job. 
           So I invested in better cooling for the CPU for my computer wich was what I wanted to overclock.
